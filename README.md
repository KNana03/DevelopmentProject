This is the repo for the INF370 group Development Project that i've done for a client, AB Fresh Wholesalers.

The frontend is done in Ionic/Angular and the backend is done in C#.

The code was done by all members of the group. The system is an inventory management system that captures all sale information, as well as keeps logs of inventory, suppliers, staff and orders.


The frontend file is "Freshflow Angular"
The backend file is "FreshflowFrontendFinal"
